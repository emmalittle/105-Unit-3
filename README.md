# COVID-19 and Mask Wearing Data 2022

## Provenance
The data used in this repository was found from the NY Times repository for COVID-19 data. In particular, the COVID data from US counties in 2022 and the reported mask use data were used to compose the data in this repository.
- [NY Times Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
- [COVID-19 2022 Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2022.csv)
- [Mask Use Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv)

## Purpose
This repository was compiled in order to present more digestable information about COVID-19 in 2022. Additionally, this repository provides the viewer with comparisons between COVID data and mask wearing data. The goal is not to sway the audience one way or another in terms of ideas regarding COVID-19, but rather to present the information objectively and allow the viewers to make their own conclusions about the data. The data presented in this repository should be digestable to the general public without any specific background information necessary to understand the composed data or related visualizations. Furthermore, this data should be relevant to nearly all U.S. citizens, as COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected society at large.

## Potential
Ideally, people should be able to look at the combined and comparative data in this repository and extrapolate their own conclusions about COVID-19 and mask wearing. Using this more condensed data should also allow viewers to expand these datasets into their own repositories and analysis more easily than if they were to use all of the original data.
